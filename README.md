## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PostDoc fellow holding a PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Parma. My research interests are oriented towards the neurophysiological bases of aesthetic experience, audio-visual perception, embodied simulation mechanisms, and peripersonal space representation and plasticity. During my PhD, my research activity focused on investigating the effect of surround sound on embodiment and sense of presence during cinematic experience through behavioral and electrophysiological studies in humans. I am particularly intrigued by the transformative potential of device mediation in shaping and influencing our perception of reality, regardless of the sensory channel involved. This fascination stems from a deep curiosity about how various technological innovations can dynamically alter our understanding and bodily experience of the world around us.//
I also have a strong interest in statistics and programming, which I consider fundamental tools for scientific research. In neuroscience, the complexity of the phenomena we study requires rigorous data analysis and robust methodologies to extract meaningful insights from experimental findings. Statistical methods not only allow us to validate hypotheses but also help in uncovering patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden. The proper application of statistical techniques ensures the reliability and reproducibility of results, which are essential pillars of the scientific method. Moreover, programming plays a crucial role not only in data processing, modeling, and visualization but also in implementing sophisticated experimental methodologies and study designs.//
I am a member of the Social Cognitive Neuroscience group directed by Prof. Vittorio Gallese and the interdepartmental lab Neuroscience&Humanities at the University of Parma, which aims to promote and develop research in the field of relations between the humanities and cognitive neurosciences.
